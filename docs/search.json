    "text": "Environmental Scientist with extensive experience in teaching, research, and consulting\n\n\nI’m Heitor C. Sousa. I am currently as a post-doc researcher at the Herpetological Collection from the University of Brasília. I have experience in biodiversity inventories, ecological and ecophysiological studies of amphibians and reptiles. I’m generally interested in ecology and evolution of animals, especially from Neotropical ecosystems, such as the dry seasonal forests (Caatinga), the Brazilian Cerrado savannas, and the Amazon rainforests. My research particularly focuses on fire ecology, biodemography (population ecology), and global climate change. I’m a highly quantitative-oriented ecologist, using statistical models to address applied problems related to sustainability and biological conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeitor investigates how lizard populations respond to environmental changes, such as climate and fire regimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Social Conservation is an interdisciplinary approach to environmental protection and resource management that prioritizes the integration of human communities, cultural values, and social equity into conservation strategies. It emphasizes the interdependence of ecological health and societal well-being, recognizing that effective conservation requires addressing human needs, rights, and participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey focuses of my work\n\nHow cultural practices (e.g., fire management) sustain biodiversity and mitigate ecological threats.\nAddressing environmental perception towards fire, climate change, and biodiversity.\nPrioritizing conservation and environmental management goals that link ecological resilience with human well-being.\n\n\nCombining ethnography, participatory mapping, and ecological fieldwork, my research in social conservation bridges disciplines like political ecology, environmental anthropology, and biocultural diversity. It directly informs strategies for equitable fire governance, species protection, and climate resilience—aligning with my work in pyrogeography and zoology (e.g., conserving culturally significant reptiles/amphibians).\n\n\nWhy it matters\nSocial conservation redefines “success” in environmental management: thriving ecosystems cannot exist without thriving communities. By integrating justice, traditional knowledge, and science, it offers pathways to heal both landscapes and social divides in an era of global change.\nCheck my publications related to social conservation here.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

It integrates atmospheric physics, ecology, geography, and social sciences to understand how human activities (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, land-use changes) alter global and regional climates—and how these shifts cascade through ecosystems and societies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey topics I study\n\nDrivers & Feedbacks: Quantifying anthropogenic influences (e.g., deforestation, fossil fuels) and natural feedback loops (e.g., wildfire-climate interactions).\nEcological Impacts: Assessing species’ responses to warming, shifting precipitation, and extreme events—from reptile thermal physiology to altered climate.\nAdaptation & Mitigation: Identifying equitable strategies to reduce risks, enhance resilience, and protect biodiversity.\n\nI use species distribution models (SDMs) and demographic models integrated with ecophysiological and microclimate data to understand species responses to climate. By using climate change projection scenarios I forecast species range, phenological, and populational changes in the future.\n\n\nWhy it matters\n\nClimate change science transcends disciplinary silos, offering actionable insights to address one of the greatest challenges of our time.

It investigates why species, communities, and ecosystems occur where they do—unraveling the roles of climate, geology, evolutionary history, and human activity in shaping biodiversity patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey questions I explore\n\nHow species respond to environmental (microclimate and vegetation) gradients?\nWhich spatial and temporal processes are most important for population and assemblage dynamics?\nHow species respond to environmental disturbances, such as climate and fire?\n\nI use geospatial, demographic, and species distribution models to understand species’ niches and range dynamics. By using this integrated framework, I can investigate how spatial and temporal processes affect species ranges and biodiversity, bridging ecology, geography, and evolutionary biology. My work contributes to the six main shortfalls of biodiversity knowledge (Hortal et al. (2015)):\n\nLinnean (unknown species)\nWallacean (unknown geographic distribution)\nPrestonian (unknown population dynamics)\nDarwinian (unknown evolutionary relationships)\nRaunkiæran (unknown functional traits and ecological functions)\nHutchinsonian (unknown niches)\n\n\n\nWhy it matters\nThese shortfalls highlight the interdisciplinary nature of biogeography, demanding integration of genomics, ecology, social sciences, and climate science.

By bridging biological, physical, and social sciences, pyrogeography seeks to unravel fire’s dual role as a natural process and a cultural artifact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey topics I explore\nI work in the three segments of pyrogeography (biota, physical environment, and society), mainly in the Brazilian Cerrado savannas, a fire-prone region.\nIn the biological sciences, I use lizards as model organisms to understand how different fire regimes—patterns of frequency, intensity, and seasonality—affect natural populations and communities.\nIn the physical sciences, I use geospatial modeling to investigate fire regimes and how climate change might influence them in the future.\nIn the social sciences, I use environmental perception methods (e.g., content analysis) and modeling to investigate how humans interact with fire.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nFire is not just a destructive force—it is a keystone process that maintains biodiversity, shapes biogeochemical cycles, and sustains cultural landscapes. Understanding its spatial and human dimensions is vital for fostering resilient ecosystems and societies in an era of global change.\nAn interdisciplinary approach is essential to achieve sustainable fire regimes in a changing world through Integrated Fire Management (IFM).\n\n\nCheck my publications related to pyrogeography here.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
