I am currently as a post-doc researcher at the Herpetological Collection from the University of Brasília. I have experience in biodiversity inventories, ecological and ecophysiological studies of amphibians and reptiles. I’m generally interested in ecology and evolution of animals, especially from Neotropical ecosystems, such as the dry seasonal forests (Caatinga), the Brazilian Cerrado savannas, and the Amazon rainforests. My research particularly focuses on fire ecology, biodemography (population ecology), and global climate change. I’m a highly quantitative-oriented ecologist, using statistical models to address applied problems related to sustainability and biological conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeitor investigates how lizard populations respond to environmental changes, such as climate and fire regimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "This product is an integration of different fire metrics derived from the monthly MapBiomas Fire product in a landscape scale (~9 km).\n\n\n\n\nSource: Monthly burned area data from MapBiomas Fogo Collection 4 (1985-2024), which provides 30m resolution mapping of fire scars across Brazil.\n\n\n\n\nFire Scars: Individual fire events were identified from the monthly data in a 9 km- cells grid.\nLandscape Metrics: For each fire scar, a suite of landscape metrics was calculated to characterize its spatial pattern. To ensure statistical robustness, variable selection was performed to remove highly collinear metrics (using VIF or correlation thresholds).\nAggregation: The metrics were averaged over the entire study period (1985-2024) and also aggregated by decade to capture temporal trends.\n\n\n\n\nThe selected metrics include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric Type\nMetric Name\nEcological Interpretation (What it Measures)\n\n\nFire Abundance\nFire Scar Density\nMeasures the number of individual fire scars per unit of area. It reflects ignition patterns and landscape constraints on fire spread. High values suggest frequent ignitions or a fragmented landscape that prevents scars from becoming large. Low values indicate fewer, potentially larger fire events.\n\n\nFire Configuration\nFire Scar Fragmentation\nMeasures how the total burned area is broken up into separate, smaller scars. It reflects the continuity of fuel and burn conditions. A high value indicates a highly fragmented burned landscape, suggesting discontinuous fuels or varied fire behavior. A low value points to a few large, contiguous fire scars.\n\n\nFire Scar Shape\nFire Scar Shape Regularity\nDescribes how compact or convoluted fire scar shapes are on average. It’s an indicator of how uniformly fire spreads. Values closer to 1 indicate simple, compact scars, typical of fires in uniform fuel with no wind. Values closer to 0 indicate highly irregular shapes, presumably driven by wind, topography, or fuel heterogeneity.\n\n\nFire Configuration\nFire Scar Isolation Variation\nMeasures the variability in the distance between a fire scar and its nearest neighboring scar. It describes the spatial clustering of fire activity. A high value suggests an uneven spatial pattern where some scars are tightly clustered while others are very isolated. A low value indicates that fire scars are more evenly spaced.\n\n\nFire Scar Interior\nMean Fire Scar Core Size\nMeasures the average size of the “core” or interior area of fire scars, buffered from the unburned edge. It represents the average extent of uninterrupted, high-intensity burning. Larger values indicate larger, more completely burned scars, while smaller values suggest smaller or narrower scars with more edge influence.\n\n\nFire Scar Interior\nFire Scar Integrity Variation\nMeasures the variability in the proportion of each fire scar that is considered “core” area. It captures the consistency of burn completeness across different scars. A high value indicates a mix of scar types: some are solid with large cores, while others are “hollow” or linear with very little core area.\n\n\nFire Scar Interior\nInternal Fire Scar Heterogeneity\nMeasures the variability in the number of unburned islands (refugia) left within individual fire scars. It’s a key indicator of burn severity and heterogeneity. A high value suggests that fire behavior is inconsistent, with some scars leaving many unburned patches and others burning more completely.\n\n\nFire frequency\nFire occurrence (monthly)\nMeasures if the cell was burned or not (binary, 0 or 1). When averaged across years, represents the proportion of years a pixel burned in each month (Jan-Dec).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: Model-based Clustering (mclust) was used to classify pixels into distinct fire regimes based on their fire metrics and monthly frequencies.\nModel Selection: The VVV (ellipsoidal, varying volume, shape, and orientation) model with 5 components (clusters) was selected based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which showed a plateau in performance improvement after 5 clusters, indicating an optimal balance between model complexity and fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe crossed the fire regime classification with land use information and the fire metrics that predicted them.

Monthly frequency is generally low or average, but relatively higher in September (late dry season).\nAssociated with native open (grasslands, savannas) and native vegetation areas with low population density.\nThese are likely large natural remnants or protected areas where fuel accumulates over longer periods.

To ensure statistical robustness, variable selection was performed to remove highly collinear metrics (using VIF or correlation thresholds).\nAggregation: The metrics were averaged over the entire study period (1985-2024) and also aggregated by decade to capture temporal trends.\n\n\n\n\nThe selected metrics include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric Type\nMetric Name\nEcological Interpretation (What it Measures)\n\n\nFire Abundance\nFire Scar Density\nMeasures the number of individual fire scars per unit of area. It reflects ignition patterns and landscape constraints on fire spread. High values suggest frequent ignitions or a fragmented landscape that prevents scars from becoming large. Low values indicate fewer, potentially larger fire events.\n\n\nFire Configuration\nFire Scar Fragmentation\nMeasures how the total burned area is broken up into separate, smaller scars. It reflects the continuity of fuel and burn conditions. A high value indicates a highly fragmented burned landscape, suggesting discontinuous fuels or varied fire behavior. A low value points to a few large, contiguous fire scars.\n\n\nFire Scar Shape\nFire Scar Shape Regularity\nDescribes how compact or convoluted fire scar shapes are on average. It’s an indicator of how uniformly fire spreads. Values closer to 1 indicate simple, compact scars, typical of fires in uniform fuel with no wind. Values closer to 0 indicate highly irregular shapes, presumably driven by wind, topography, or fuel heterogeneity.\n\n\nFire Configuration\nFire Scar Isolation Variation\nMeasures the variability in the distance between a fire scar and its nearest neighboring scar. It describes the spatial clustering of fire activity. A high value suggests an uneven spatial pattern where some scars are tightly clustered while others are very isolated. A low value indicates that fire scars are more evenly spaced.\n\n\nFire Scar Interior\nMean Fire Scar Core Size\nMeasures the average size of the “core” or interior area of fire scars, buffered from the unburned edge. It represents the average extent of uninterrupted, high-intensity burning. Larger values indicate larger, more completely burned scars, while smaller values suggest smaller or narrower scars with more edge influence.\n\n\nFire Scar Interior\nFire Scar Integrity Variation\nMeasures the variability in the proportion of each fire scar that is considered “core” area. It captures the consistency of burn completeness across different scars. A high value indicates a mix of scar types: some are solid with large cores, while others are “hollow” or linear with very little core area.\n\n\nFire Scar Interior\nInternal Fire Scar Heterogeneity\nMeasures the variability in the number of unburned islands (refugia) left within individual fire scars. It’s a key indicator of burn severity and heterogeneity. A high value suggests that fire behavior is inconsistent, with some scars leaving many unburned patches and others burning more completely.\n\n\nFire frequency\nFire occurrence (monthly)\nMeasures if the cell was burned or not (binary, 0 or 1).
